# MethyTurts

13 06 2022 James update: R on the cluster doesn't show plots. Making the main objects in R, then saving them as RDS files (or RData if multiple objects) in the git repo so 
we can pull them to local repos and work on them locally. 

Ideally we will save data straight to git data dir (as opposed to saving in SBCS-Eizaguirre and copying to git repo and pushing). At the moment R data objects saved to 
Turtle_WGBS/03_MethylKit/data/output
